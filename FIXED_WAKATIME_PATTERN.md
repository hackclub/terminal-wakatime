# âœ… Fixed: Correct WakaTime Plugin Pattern Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Was Wrong Before**

Our initial implementation used custom heartbeat frequency management:
- We were rate-limiting calls to wakatime-cli based on our own `HeartbeatFrequency` config
- We tried to manage when to send heartbeats ourselves
- This was **not** following the official WakaTime plugin pattern

## ðŸš€ **What We Fixed**

Now we follow the **official WakaTime plugin pattern** exactly as documented at:
https://wakatime.com/help/creating-plugin

### **âœ… Official Pattern Implementation:**

```go
// Call wakatime-cli if: enoughTimeHasPassed OR fileChanged OR isWriteEvent
func (t *Tracker) shouldSendHeartbeat(activity *Activity) bool {
    // Always send on write events (file save)
    if activity.IsWrite {
        return true
    }

    // Always send if file has changed
    if activity.Entity != t.lastSentFile {
        return true
    }

    // Send if enough time has passed (2 minutes as per WakaTime spec)
    return time.Since(t.lastSentTime) >= config.WakaTimeInterval
}
```

### **ðŸ”§ Key Changes Made:**

1. **Removed custom rate limiting** - No more `lastSent` map with complex logic
2. **Implemented official 2-minute rule** - Hard-coded 2 minutes as per WakaTime spec
3. **Always send on file changes** - Different file = immediate call to wakatime-cli
4. **Always send on file saves** - Write events always trigger wakatime-cli
5. **Let wakatime-cli handle everything else** - Rate limiting, deduplication, API logic

## ðŸ“‹ **The Official WakaTime Plugin Pattern**

From the official documentation:

```python
# Official WakaTime plugin pattern
if enoughTimeHasPassed(lastSentTime) or currentlyFocusedFileHasChanged(lastSentFile) or isFileSavedEvent():
    sendFileToWakatimeCLI()
else:
    # do nothing
    pass
```

Where:
- `enoughTimeHasPassed()` = **2 minutes** since last call to wakatime-cli  
- `currentlyFocusedFileHasChanged()` = different file than last time
- `isFileSavedEvent()` = always send on file save

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits of This Approach**

1. **âœ… Matches all official plugins** - Same behavior as VS Code, Vim, Sublime, etc.
2. **âœ… Better accuracy** - wakatime-cli has sophisticated deduplication logic
3. **âœ… Simpler code** - Less complexity in our plugin
4. **âœ… Better performance** - wakatime-cli handles batching and caching
5. **âœ… Future-proof** - Will work with any wakatime-cli improvements

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Results**

- All existing tests pass âœ…
- New `TestShouldSendHeartbeat` test validates the correct behavior âœ…  
- Demo script shows proper editor detection and suggestions âœ…
- Follows official WakaTime plugin guidelines exactly âœ…

## ðŸ“– **Documentation Updated**

- README.md updated to reflect correct approach
- Config help text clarified that heartbeat-frequency is for display only
- Comments added explaining that wakatime-cli handles actual rate limiting

---

**Result:** Our Terminal WakaTime plugin now behaves **exactly like all official WakaTime plugins**! ðŸŽ‰
